# NWUVaalNavigation System

The **NWUVaalNavigation** system is a web-based application developed using **ASP.NET** and **CSS**, designed to provide an interactive map of the Vanderbijlpark campus of North-West University (NWU). The project was developed as part of a team effort to create a user-friendly solution for navigating campus locations. While the initial goal was to build a fully functional navigation system to guide users to specific locations on campus, the current version does not support navigation or direction-giving functionality.

## Project Overview

The **NWUVaalNavigation System** offers users an interactive map of the NWU Vanderbijlpark campus with a **Google Maps-style layout**. The system allows users to explore various points of interest (POIs) on campus, including academic buildings, libraries, residence halls, cafeterias, and more. 

However, it is important to note that the system currently **does not provide real-time directions** or route mapping between campus locations. This feature was planned but remains unimplemented due to time constraints and technical challenges faced during development.

### Key Features
- **Interactive Campus Map**: A visual layout of the NWU Vanderbijlpark campus, built with Google Maps API integration.
- **Campus Points of Interest (POIs)**: The map highlights major buildings and locations on campus, such as faculty buildings, sports facilities, and other key landmarks.
- **Responsive Design**: The system is designed using CSS to ensure it is responsive and accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Technologies Used
- **ASP.NET**: For building the back-end and web application logic.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout of the user interface.
- **Google Maps API**: For rendering the map and adding campus locations as markers.

## How to Install and Run the Project

To get the project running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**   
2. **Open the project**:
   Open the project in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
3. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure that all the necessary NuGet packages for ASP.NET and the Google Maps API are installed.
4. **Run the application**:
   Press `F5` in Visual Studio to run the project locally. The application will open in your browser, displaying the campus map.

## Project Limitations
As a group project, several limitations were encountered during development:

- **No Navigation Functionality**: Although the system was initially intended to provide users with turn-by-turn directions to their desired destinations on campus, this feature remains unimplemented. Users can view the campus map but are not able to get directions to specific locations.
- **Static Data**: The points of interest (POIs) on the map are hardcoded and not dynamically updated based on user input or external data sources.
- **Limited Scope**: The system currently only covers the NWU Vanderbijlpark campus and does not support other NWU campuses.

## Future Improvements
Given more time and resources, the following features could be implemented to enhance the system:
- **Route Mapping & Directions**: Integrating Google Maps routing functionality to allow users to input a starting point and destination for directions.
- **Dynamic POI Updates**: Allowing for real-time updates to campus locations and points of interest.
- **User Input**: Adding a feature where users can search for specific locations or services on campus.
- **Cross-Campus Support**: Expanding the system to include navigation and maps for other NWU campuses.

## Lessons Learned
This project provided invaluable experience in the following areas:
- **Collaboration**: Working as part of a team to manage the project's scope and delegate responsibilities effectively.
- **Web Development**: Hands-on experience with ASP.NET and CSS, enhancing our skills in front-end and back-end development.
- **API Integration**: Learning how to integrate third-party APIs (Google Maps) into a web application.

## Contributions
This project was a collaborative group effort, with each member contributing to different aspects of the system's design and functionality:
- **Frontend Development**: Focus on creating the user interface using CSS and ensuring a responsive design.
- **Backend Development**: Building the web application's functionality using ASP.NET.
- **Map Integration**: Implementing the Google Maps API for displaying the campus layout and POIs.
